 DOG YEARS
 Converts a person's age to “dog years”.
 
 INFORMATION
 Dogs mature faster than humans. It is believed that a dog’s age is calculated in “Dog Years”, which could be used to compare their growth rate with a person of  the same age. The assumption is that 10 human years is equivalent to 53 "dog years". Hence, we assume that time moves faster for dogs.

 THE PROGRAM
 <ul>
  <li>The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.</li>
  <li>Each year following equates to 4 dog years.</li>
 </ul>
