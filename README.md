 DOG YEARS
 Converts a person's age to “dog years”.
 
 <p>INFORMATION</p>
 <p>
  Dogs mature faster than humans. It is believed that a dog’s age is calculated in “Dog Years”, which could be used to compare their growth rate with a person    of the same age. The assumption is that 10 human years is equivalent to 53 "dog years". Hence, we assume time moves faster for dogs.
